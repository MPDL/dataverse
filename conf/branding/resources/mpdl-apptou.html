        <h1> Terms of Service of the Max Planck Digital Library </h1>

        <h3>General</h3>
        <p>General Terms of Service apply to services provided by Max Planck Digital Library (MPDL) on behalf of Max
            Planck
            Society. Please be aware that enhanced Terms of Services may take effect for specific services. Please check
            the
            particular service websites for further information.</p>
        <p>By using a service of the MPDL, users enter into a binding agreement to accept the Terms of Service described
            herein and agree to be bound by them. Users who do not agree to these Terms of Service please refrain from
            using
            services of the MPDL.</p>
        <p>Users represent that they have the legal authority to accept these Terms.</p>

        <h3>Registration</h3>
        <p>Uploading content to MPDL services may require user’s registration. By registering, user agrees to only
            provide
            true and accurate information about herself. Personal data that is entered in the registration process is
            used
            only for authorization purposes and will not be given to third parties unless required by law.</p>
        <p>User access may be revoked on violation of the Terms of Service.</p>

        <h3>User´s Warranty</h3>
        <p>If a user uploads content into a Max Planck Digital Libraries service, she warrants that</p>
        <ul>
            <li>content provided by her and made available through the service does not violate or infringe the rights
                of
                any third party, including copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity or other personal or proprietary
                rights
            </li>
            <li>she owns or otherwise controls all rights required for submitting the content to a specific service</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a user publishes content through a Max Planck Digital Library service, she warrants that content is

        <ul>
            <li>interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the sites and services or any related

                confidentiality of the MPDL services and will be disclosed to the law enforcement authorities for

            </li>
            <li>User shall exonerate MPDL from all claims if any such are made on MPDL by third parties because of the

                will explain the dispute to the user insofar as third parties take legal action against MPDL.
