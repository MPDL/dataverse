    <br><br>
    <h2><strong>Data Publishing</strong></h2>
    <a name="DOI"></a>
    <h3>Does Edmond provide Digital Object Identifiers (DOI)?</h3>
    Yes, Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) are automatically provided for each dataset version. The DOI is immediately
    reserved by creating a dataset. When a dataset is published, the DOI will then resolve. The same goes for each new
    version of an existing dataset.

    <a name="DOI-reserve"></a>
    <h3>Is it possible to reserve a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for an unpublished dataset?</h3>
    Yes, Edmond does this automatically. For each new dataset, a DOI will be reserved.

    <a name="Benefits"></a>
    <h3>What are the benefits of depositing my research data?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Your data will be preserved, even for your own future use.</li>
      <li>The publishing process creates a permanent record with a persistent identifier and a suggested citation, so
        that your work can be formally attributed when re-analysed by others.</li>
      <li>Your data will be discoverable through search engines to maximize visibility and impact.</li>
      <li>By providing access to your research data, you can fulfil the requirements of scientific journals, financial
        sponsors and other parties who have supported your research.</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="Why-Use"></a>
    <h3>Why should I use Edmond for publishing my data?</h3>
    Edmond is hosted by the Max Planck Digital Library, which means your data will not leave the Max Planck Society.
    The use of Edmond and the Edmond support is free of charge.

    <a name="Reviewer"></a>
    <h3>How can I share my dataset with others before publishing the dataset?</h3>
    You can create a private URL for your unpublished dataset. With this link anyone can access your dataset without
    login. You can use this link i.e. to share it for a review process, when reviewers want to see your unpublished data
    in advance. For a detailed description of how to create a private link to your dataset, please see the following <a
          href="https://guides.dataverse.org/en/5.9/user/dataset-management.html#private-url-to-review-unpublished-dataset"
          target="_blank">section in the generic Dataverse Guide</a>.

    <a name="Published-datasets"></a>
    <h3>Who can search and access a published dataset?</h3>
    When you published your dataset, anyone can search and access it. Edmond is an Open Research Data Repository, which
    includes openness by design.

    <a name="Withdraw"></a>
    <h3>Can I withdraw my published dataset?</h3>
    Yes, it is possible to withdraw a dataset after it was published. This can be done via the menu "Edit Dataset" and
    then the button "Deaccession Dataset". It is necessary to give a comment on why the dataset will be withdrawn. After that,
    only metadata and your comment are available for other users, but not your files anymore. The DOI is still resolving.

    <a name="Cite"></a>
    <h3>How can I cite a published dataset?</h3>
    You can find a citation suggestion for the dataset at the top of the dataset page. You can also download the
    citation in different file formats.

    <br><br>
    <h2><strong>Datasets</strong></h2>
    <a name="Dataset-information"></a>
    <h3>What information is mandatory for a dataset?</h3>
    Four information are mandatory:
    <ul>
      <li>Title of the dataset</li>
      <li>Author</li>
      <li>Institution</li>
      <li>Study Type</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="File-structure"></a>
    <h3>Can I use a folder structure for my dataset?</h3>
    Yes, a folder structure is possible. You can generate the folder structure with different files in it. The <a
          href="#Client">DVUploader</a> is also a comfortable way to create complex file structures.

    <a name="Dataset-delete"></a>
    <h3>Can I delete a dataset that I have created?</h3>
    Yes, an unpublished dataset can be deleted. All information and files will be deleted and cannot be restored.
    A published dataset cannot be deleted, only withdrawn. Please see the <a href="#Withdraw">description here</a>.

    <a name="Dataset-published"></a>
    <h3>Can I make changes to my published dataset?</h3>
    Yes, changes on published datasets are always possible. You can i.e. add or delete files and also edit metadata. All
    will lead to a new version of the dataset, which needs to be published again. Depending on the changes, minor or
    major release versions of the dataset are available. The new version will receive a new DOI. Thereby it is fully
    available and citable.

    <a name="Versioning"></a>
    <h3>Does Edmond provide versioning for datasets?</h3>
    Yes, Edmond provides versioning of datasets. For published datasets you can select between minor and major
    versions, i.e. 1.1 or 2.0 and so on. For more information, please see the following <a
          href="https://guides.dataverse.org/en/5.9/user/dataset-management.html#dataset-versions" target="_blank">section in the generic Dataverse Guide</a>.

    <a name="Dataset-license"></a>
    <h3>Under what licenses can I publish a dataset?</h3>
    Edmond supports flexible licensing. Following licenses are recommended:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://creativecommons.org/" target="_blank"> Creative Commons </a> <br>
        Creative Commons licenses were originally created for the legally secure licensing of creative content, not
        primarily for data. But since version 4, this slightly different nature of data is kept in mind so that CC-BY 4.0
        and CC-BY- SA 4.0 are also usable for research data. The advantage of CC licenses is their wide distribution and
        awareness. <br>
        By licensing your research outputs under CC-BY, your research is openly available, but it is required that
        others have to give you credit, in the form of a citation, should they use or refer to your research object.
        <br>
        This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they
        credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. Recommended for
        maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials.
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/" target="_blank"> Open Data Commons </a> <br>
        Open Data Commons has developed standard licenses directly for data, therefore they are likely to fit a bit
        better. But they are just not as widespread as CC licenses.
      </li>
      <li> Public Domain <br>
        Not uncommon is the use of public domain waivers as <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"
                                                               target="_blank">CC0</a> or Open Data Commons <a
                href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/" target="_blank">Public Domain Dedication and License
          (PDDL)</a> for research data. Here, the greatest possible freedom is granted in handling the data. Depending
        on the type of data, this can be useful, but it also leaves possibilities to misuse the data. <br>
        Although CC0 does not legally require users of the data to cite the source, it does not take away the moral
        responsibility to give attribution, as is common in scientific research.
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://www.govdata.de/lizenzen" target="_blank">Datenlizenz Deutschland</a> <br>
        Through a collaboration between federal, state and municipal associations, Datenlizenz Deutschland has developed
        a recommendation for uniform conditions for the use of administrative data in Germany, which now exists as "data
        license Germany" in version 2.0. This version is officially accepted as an open license by the Council of
        Experts of the <a href="https://opendefinition.org/" target="_blank">Open Definition</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    A tabular overview of the different licenses can be found on the German page <a
          href="http://forschungslizenzen.de/" target="_blank">“Forschungslizenzen”</a>.<br>
    If no license is manually assigned, the data within Edmond will automatically be released to the public domain under
    <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" target="_blank"> CC0</a>.

    <br><br>
    <h2><strong>Files</strong></h2>
    <a name="Items-type"></a>
    <h3>What types of data files can I upload?</h3>
    You can upload all types of data files. There is no limitation. Of course, it should be in formats that make sense
    for the use and reuse of your dataset. Own software code can also be uploaded.

    <a name="Limits"></a>
    <h3>What are the size limits?</h3>
    There are no size limits in Edmond. But please note that uploading large amounts of files via the browser can be
    time-consuming depending on the infrastructure. The <a href="#Client">DVUploader</a> is specially designed to upload
    large amounts of files into Edmond. Please contact our <a href="#" onclick="_2edmond();return false;" target="_blank">Edmond
    support team</a> if you have any questions.

    <a name="Zip"></a>
    <h3>Can I upload a zip file instead of many single files?</h3>
    Yes, you can. By uploading a zip file, Edmond is detecting the corresponding folder structure and will represent
    this as folder structure in your dataset.

    <a name="File-delete"></a>
    <h3>How can I delete a file?</h3>
    Deleting an item from a published dataset will lead to a new version of the general dataset. See also the answer on <a
          href="#Versioning">versioning in Edmond</a>.

    <a name="File-move"></a>
    <h3>How can I move a file?</h3>
    You can move a file on the file level. This is possible via edit metadata, where also the "File Path" is available.
    Through this, moving a file to different folders is possible.

    <br><br>
    <h2><strong>Technical</strong></h2>
    <a name="Edmond-technology"></a>
    <h3>Which technology is used for Edmond?</h3>
    Edmond uses the <a href="https://dataverse.org" target="_blank"> Dataverse software</a>, an open-source community-driven development.

    <a name="Safe"></a>
    <h3>Is my data safe with Edmond?</h3>
    Edmond uses diverse strategies to back up the data (back up of the server and of the database itself). These backups
    are created in frequent intervals (the shortest is every 12 hours) and are stored in several locations on servers of
    the Max Planck Society as well as on tapes.

    <a name="Client"></a>
    <h3>Does Edmond provide a client?</h3>
    Yes, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-uploader" target="_blank">DVUploader</a> for that.
    For more information, please see the following <a
          href="https://guides.dataverse.org/en/5.9/user/dataset-management.html#command-line-dvuploader"
          target="_blank">section in the generic Dataverse Guide</a>.

    <a name="API"></a>
    <h3>Does Edmond provide an API?</h3>
    Yes, an API is available. The documentation of the Dataverse API is available in <a
          href="https://guides.dataverse.org/en/5.9/api/index.html" target="_blank">the generic Dataverse Guide</a>.
