    <h2><b>General</b></h2>

    <h3><a name="Benefits"></a>What are the benefits of depositing my data?</h3>

    <p>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Your data will be preserved - even for your own future use</li>
      <li> The publishing process creates a permanent record with a persistent identifier and a suggested citation, so
        that your work can be formally attributed when re-analyzed by others
      </li>
      <li> Your data will be discoverable through Google and other search engines to maximize visibility and impact</li>
      <li> By providing access to your research data you can fulfill the requirements of scientific journals, financial
        sponsors and other parties who have supported your research
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>

    <h3><a name="Usage"></a>Why should I use Edmond for publishing my data?</h3>

    <p>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Edmond is hosted by the Max Planck Digital Library which means that your data will not leave the Max Planck
        Society
      </li>
      <li> The use of Edmond and the Edmond support is free of charge</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Fits for all disciplines</li>
      <li> Support of long term preservation</li>
      <li> REST- API</li>
      <li> Integration of DOI assignment</li>
      <li> Automatic extraction of technical metadata</li>
      <li> Definition of variable metadata profiles for a flexible metadata management</li>
    </ul>
    A list of all features can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/MPDL/imeji/wiki/Features" target="_blank">imeji
    homepage</a>. <br>
    <p></p>

    <h3><a name="Peerreview"></a>Can I give peer reviewers access to my unpublished Edmond data?</h3>

    <p>
      Yes, please contact our <a href="mailto:edmond@mpdl.mpg.de" target="_blank">support</a>. We will create a
      "Reviewer" account. You can then share your collection with "Reviewer" and communicate login data to the journal.
      Reviewers will remain anonymous.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="Repositories"></a>What other repositories do exist where I can publish my data?</h3>

    <p>
      The amount of available data repositories is increasing every day. Some repositories are discipline specific,
      other are institutional like Edmond. The Registry of Research Data Repositories (Re3Data) started an attempt to
      collect <a href="http://service.re3data.org/search?query=repository" target="_blank"> all known data
      repositories</a>. This list can also be sorted based on the <a
            href="http://service.re3data.org/browse/by-subject/" target="_blank"> different disciplines </a>.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="Name"></a>Where does the name come from?</h3>

    <p>
      The first collection in Edmond were <a href="https://edmond.mpdl.mpg.de/imeji/collection/lnliBOpQ_skRFX9Hy"
                                             target="_blank"> images of the nucleus of the comet Halley </a> . Therefore
      the repository was named after Edmond Halley (8. November 1656 – 14 January 1742), an English astronomer who is
      best known for computing the orbit of the eponymous Halley's Comet and after whom the comet is named.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="Costs"></a>What does it cost?</h3>

    <p>
      The usage of Edmond and also the Edmond support is free of charge to all members of the Max Planck Society. It is
      a service provided by the <a href="https://www.mpdl.mpg.de/" target="_blank"> Max Planck Digital Library
      (MPDL) </a>.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="Licenses"></a>Under what licenses can I publish my data within Edmond?</h3>

    <p>
      Edmond supports flexible licensing. Following licenses are recommended:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://creativecommons.org/" target="_blank"> Creative Commons </a> <br>
        Creative Commons licenses were originally created for the legally secure licensing of creative content, not
        primary for data. But since version 4 this slightly different nature of data is kept in mind so that CC-BY 4.0
        and CC-BY- SA 4.0 are also usable for research data. The advantage of CC licenses is their wide distribution and
        awareness. <br>
        By licensing your research outputs under CC-BY, your research is openly available, but it is required that
        others have to give you credit, in the form of a citation, should they use or refer to your research object.
        <br>
        This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they
        credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. Recommended for
        maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials.
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/" target="_blank"> Open Data Commons </a> <br>
        Open Data Commons has developed standard licenses directly for data, therefore are likely to fit a little bit
        better. But they are just not as widespread as CC licenses.
      </li>
      <li> Public Domain <br>
        Not uncommon is the use of public domain waivers as <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"
                                                               target="_blank"> CC-0 </a> or Open Data Commons <a
                href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/" target="_blank"> Public Domain Dedication and License
          (PDDL) </a> for research data. Here, the greatest possible freedom is granted in handling the data. Depending
        on the type of data, this can be useful, but it also leaves possibilities to misuse the data. <br>
        Although CC0 doesn’t legally require users of the data to cite the source, it does not take away the moral
        responsibility to give attribution, as is common in scientific research.
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://www.govdata.de/lizenzen" target="_blank"> Datenlizenz Deutschland </a> <br>
        Through a collaboration between federal, state and municipal associations, Datenlizenz Deutschland has developed
        a recommendation for uniform conditions for the use of administrative data in Germany, which now exists as "data
        license Germany" in version 2.0. This version is officially accepted as an open license by the Council of
        Experts of the <a href="https://opendefinition.org/" target="_blank"> Open Definition </a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    A tabular overview about the different licenses can be found on the German page <a
          href="http://forschungslizenzen.de/" target="_blank"> “Forschungslizenzen” </a>. <br>
    <b>If no license is manually assigned, the data within Edmond will automatically be released to the public domain
      under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank"> CC-BY 4.0 </a>. </b>

    <p></p>

    <h3><a name="Technology"></a>Which technology is used for Edmond?</h3>

    <p>
      Edmond uses the <a href="https://github.com/MPDL/imeji" target="_blank"> imeji software</a>, an open source
      community driven development, initiated and supported by the <a href="https://www.mpdl.mpg.de/" target="_blank">
      Max Planck Digital Library (MPDL) </a>.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="Information"></a>Do you provide more information on Research Data Management?</h3>

    <p>
      Yes, we do. Please visit our <a href="https://rdm.mpdl.mpg.de" target="_blank"> information platform on Research
      Data Management</a>. If you have further questions regarding research data management, please contact our <a
            href="mailto:rdm@mpdl.mpg.de" target="_blank">RDM support team</a>.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2><b>Technical</b></h2>

    <h3><a name="Limits"></a>What are the size limits in Edmond?</h3>

    <p>
      The default disk quota per user on Edmond is 10GB. If you need more, please contact our <a
            href="mailto:edmond@mpdl.mpg.de" target="_blank">support</a> <br>
      However, please note that individual files larger than ~5GB may be problematic to transfer over the Internet.

    </p>

    <h3><a name="Content"></a>What can I upload?</h3>

    <p>
      Edmond uses the ImageMagick software to generate preview pictures of the uploaded content. Therefore Edmond
      supports more than <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/formats.php#supported" target="_blank"> 100 major
      file formats </a>. Nevertheless you can upload all content in imeji, there are no restrictions.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="Safety"></a>Is my data safe with you?</h3>

    <p>
      Edmond uses diverse strategies to back up the data (back up of the server and of the database itself). These
      backups are created in frequent intervals (the shortest is every 12 hours) and are stored in several locations on
      servers of the MPG as well as on tapes.
